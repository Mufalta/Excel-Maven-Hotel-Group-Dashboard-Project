# Maven-Hotel-Group-Dashboard-Project

Hi ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to the **Maven-Hotel-Group-Dashboard-Project** repository!  
First of all, a huge thanks to **Maven Analytics** for guiding me to build this dashboard project using Excel. This project demonstrates how to create a dashboard for transforming some interesting insights into a visualization. In this imaginary case, I'm playing the role as a Data Visualization Specialist for Maven Hotel Group (MHG), a Portuguese hotel chain with resorts in Lisbon and Algarve.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
1. Creating a dashboard based on key insights during exploratory data analysis.
2. Utilized column charts, combo charts, pivot charts, and stacked bar charts for effective visualization.
3. Leverage the dashboard layout and text to clearly communicate key insights and business recommendations.

## Business Problem

First, let's take a look at this image below:

As you can see, we received an email from our teammate Billy, a Business Analyst, requesting our help to build a dashboard for reporting purposes. He also included the dataset along with some interesting insights he discovered. Okay, so our next step is to open the file he attached in the email:

In the Excel file, there are two sheets: one contains the dataset, and the other contains the analysis prepared by our teammate. Next, weâ€™re going to spend most of our time working in the analysis worksheet. As you can see, we clearly have a lot to figure out, so itâ€™s better to break it down into several parts.

### Seasonality Analysis

In this section, we analyzed seasonality to identify patterns in cancellation rates and average daily rates. During July and August, we observe a spike in both cancellation rates and average daily rates, indicating that while customers are willing to pay higher rates during summer, they are also more likely to cancel.
